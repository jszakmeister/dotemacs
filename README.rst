This is an attempt to put together an Emacs configuration that is sane and
productive.  Emacs has thousand of configuration options, and packages, so this
is my attempt to pull together useful ones to get you started.

I don't claim that my configuration will work for everybody, so I've designed
this configuration for long-term branching.  There is a user/ area to stash your
custom configuration details.  Take a look at mine configuration in the user
area as an example of what you can do.
