Evil
====

Evil is a Vim emulation for Emacs that is pretty true to Vim, but still exposes
the some of my favorite functionality from Vim (such as text objects).  The
`Emacs wiki <http://emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil>`_ has more information.

There is also a nice article on diving into evil mode, and tailoring to your
needs `here <http://dnquark.com/blog/2012/02/emacs-evil-ecumenicalism/>`_.
